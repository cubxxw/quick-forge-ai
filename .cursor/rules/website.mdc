Nextra 4.0 Migration Notice for AI Assistance

Please be aware of the following major changes introduced in Nextra 4.0 to ensure compatibility and best practices:
	1.	App Router by Default: Nextra 4.0 is fully built on Next.js App Router. The legacy Pages Router is no longer supported. Please structure content under the app/ directory accordingly.
	2.	Updated Layout System: Introduces layout.js and template.js files for more flexible, nested, and section-based layouts.
	3.	Theme Config Changes: The structure of theme.config.ts has been updated. Some fields (like project.link, docsRepositoryBase) may have been renamed or relocated — refer to the latest docs when updating.
	4.	Enhanced MDX Support: Modernized MDX pipeline with broader support for Remark/Rehype plugins. Custom plugins may need to be adapted.
	5.	Standardized Component Imports: Official components should be imported from @nextra/components. Legacy manual imports may not be compatible anymore.
	6.	Improved i18n and Localization: Built-in support for better multi-language routing and content structure. Make sure to define language paths clearly in config.
	7.	Build Performance Optimizations: Leveraging faster compilers and resolvers; note that some build hooks or plugin orders may behave differently.
    8. Nextra 4.0 no longer supports the direct use of the theme and themeConfig properties in the configuration.

Please ensure you’re using Nextra 4.0’s structure and configuration correctly — especially the App Router layout system, the updated theme.config.ts, and the new MDX plugin pipeline. Avoid deprecated APIs or legacy patterns from earlier versions.
