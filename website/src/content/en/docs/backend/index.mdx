# Backend Development

The Quick Forge AI backend is built with FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python. This section covers the backend architecture, key components, and how to extend the backend for your needs.

## Architecture Overview

The backend follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer** - FastAPI routes and endpoints 
2. **Service Layer** - Business logic and operations
3. **Data Layer** - Database models and data access
4. **Core** - Configuration, security, and shared components

This separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

## Key Technologies

- **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework
- **SQLModel**: SQL database interactions with type safety
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **Alembic**: Database migration system
- **JWT**: Authentication tokens
- **Pytest**: Testing framework

## Getting Started with Backend Development

To start developing the backend:

1. **Understand the existing code**: 
   - Familiarize yourself with the API routes in `app/api/routes/`
   - Review the data models in `app/db/models/`
   - Look at the service implementations in `app/services/`

2. **Set up your development environment**:
   - Follow the [setup instructions](/en/docs/getting-started) 
   - Activate the Python virtual environment
   - Run the backend with hot-reload: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

3. **Access the API documentation**:
   - Once running, view the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
   - The OpenAPI schema is at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json`

## Main Components

### API Routes

API routes are organized in the `app/api/routes/` directory by feature area. Each module contains related endpoints. For example:

- `users.py` - User management operations
- `auth.py` - Authentication and authorization
- `items.py` - Item CRUD operations

### Dependency Injection

FastAPI's dependency injection system is used extensively to:
- Inject database sessions
- Validate authentication and permissions
- Share common functionality

Dependencies are defined in `app/api/deps.py`.

### Database Models

Data models are defined using SQLModel, which combines the best of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic. Models are located in `app/db/models/`.

### Business Logic

Complex business logic is separated into service modules in `app/services/` to keep the route handlers clean and focused on HTTP concerns.
