# Getting Started with Quick Forge AI

Welcome to Quick Forge AI, a powerful AI application building platform. This article will guide you through the setup process and create your first AI application.

## Installation and Configuration

First, you need to install the Quick Forge AI CLI:

```bash
npm install -g quick-forge-ai-cli
```

After installation, initialize a new project:

```bash
quick-forge init my-ai-app
cd my-ai-app
```

## Creating Your First AI Component

Quick Forge AI builds AI applications using a component-based approach. Here are the steps to create a simple chatbot component:

```javascript
// Creating a chatbot component
import { AIComponent } from 'quick-forge-ai';

export const ChatBot = () => {
  return (
    <AIComponent
      type="chat"
      model="gpt-4"
      prompt="You are a helpful assistant, answer user questions."
    />
  );
};
```

## Integrating into Your Application

Integrate the component into your application:

```javascript
import { ChatBot } from './components/ChatBot';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <header>
        <h1>My AI Application</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        <ChatBot />
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Running the Application

Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
